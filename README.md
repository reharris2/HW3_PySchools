## Observations

- Per Student Budgets are not an indicator of student success.  In fact, as budgets per student increased, passing rates of students 
  decreased.
- Enrollment sizes larger than 2000 students is an indicator that a school my underperform.
- What Data is Missing?
  - The five top performing schools are charter schools.  The five bottom performing schools are district schools.  Data on parental        involvement/action is not included.  In order to gain enrollment in a charter school, a parent has to apply for the lottery or take some action/research.  To me, this would indicate that education is a priority to the parent.  In addition, no data is provided on expulsion rates.  Charter schools can expel problem/underperforming students while district schools have to deal with students unless they violate a major school policy.  Some charter schools do a masterful job educating children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds; however, the data between the school types may not be comparable.
